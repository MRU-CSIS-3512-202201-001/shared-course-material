# Learning Resource List

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

If you've got a GitHub account (you've got a GitHub account, right?), as an MRU student, you're eligible to get the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Sign up for it - it's easy.

There's so much free stuff in the Pack that it's stupid.

You'll need the Pack if you want to access the Frontend Masters I talk about below.


## [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)

Wes is a Canadian web developer that creates a lot of awesome content. Some of it is free.

His "courses" are basically small(ish) exercises that are accompanied by a video where he walks through the solution. Very hands-on, very useful.

Here are 3 free courses that you will find useful:

1. [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/). Very nice if you need a refresher on using Grid.
2. [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/). Like the Grid course, but for Flexbox.
3. [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/). Probably want to save this for after you've picked up JS...but these 30 exercises are fun and a great way to keep your JS skills sharp, or to get a leg up on the course.


## [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)

My go-to site for excellent frontend education. Most of the content you have to pay for (and it's not exactly cheap), but there is some excellent free content AND if you have the GitHub Student Developer Pack mentioned above, you can get 6 months of free access.

1. (Free) [Web Development Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/). 21 hours of free content. If it's been a while since you've CSS'd, you could take a spin through the [Introduction to CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/introduction-css/) portion. The [Introduction to JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/introduction-javascript/) portion is taught by my favorite instructor on FEM, Brian Holt.
2. (Paid) [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) and [JavaScript: The New Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/). After you've got some JS under your belt and you want to develop a deeper understanding of JS, these are great courses to watch. Plus, Will's got an awesome accent.
3. (Paid) [Getting Started with JavvaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/) is a good intro to the language, while [Deep JavaScript Foundations, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/) is, like the material mentioned in 2, is aimed more toward someone who has some JS experience, but wants a deeper understanding of the language. Highly recommended. 

## [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/)

This site has a ton of awesome visual design tips for us developer types. It's pretty cool how just a few tips, like those talked about in [7 Practical Tips for Cheating at Design](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886), can make your work look pretty darn professional!

## [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

I plan on using Tailwind for our assignments this semester, so you should get a leg up on learning some of this stuff.

Use the [Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) instead of the other installation methods, which are more aimed towards professional use.

They also have a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/tailwindlabs) with gobs of content. I really liked the [Tailwind Talk: "My Second Hour with Tailwind CSS" with Petr Tichy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18I7bYe-e3o) video.

## Git/GitHub

Ah, Git and GitHub...how I love and hate you in equal measure. We're going to be using GitHub all the time in this course (as you might have guessed from the fact that this document itself is on GitHub), so you should get somewhat comfortable with it.

I wish I could give you a comprehensive list of suggestions as to what to read/watch to get you up to snuff, but there are just WAY too many resources out there about Git and GitHub. 

That being said, here are a few things to look at:

1. https://learngitbranching.js.org/. Branching can be hard to wrap your head around at first. This visually-focused site can help things make sense.
2. There are a ton of Git cheat sheets out there. I like [this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-git-cheatsheet-that-all-coders-need-bf8ad4d91576). For now.
3. [Learn Git in 15 Minutes](https://youtu.be/USjZcfj8yxE)
4. [Learn GitHub in 20 Minutes](https://youtu.be/nhNq2kIvi9s)
5. [Git Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/DVRQoVRzMIY) 
6. GitHub has a bunch of suggested resources for beginners:
   1. [A short video explaining what GitHub is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be) 
   2. [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/git-and-github-learning-resources) 
   3. [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
   4. [How to use GitHub branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5GJfcp3p4Q&feature=youtu.be)
   5. [Interactive Git training materials](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/01_getting_ready_for_class)
   6. [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
   7. [Education community forum](https://education.github.community/)
   8. [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/)
