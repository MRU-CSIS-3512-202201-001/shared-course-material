## Previews

In order to help you prepare for tutorials, you can access the following "stripped-down" versions of some tutorials; they give you a general idea what the tutorial is about, without providing full details.

_N/A means "not available (yet). If there's no entry at all for the tutorial, it means that tutorial won't ever have one!"_

| Tutorial Number | Preview Link |

| 04              | [N/A](#)     |

| 07              | [N/A](#)     |

## GitHub Classroom Links

These are the links to the GitHub Classroom "assignments" you need to accept and clone to a local repo to do the tutorials. 

**Make sure you choose the link associated with your tutorial time**: if you're in the 11 AM section and accept a 10 AM assignment, I'm going to assume that you're trying to get a head-start on things. That's not fair to the folks in the 10 AM section...and I'm going to karma-ding you accordingly. _(Naturally, if you do this by mistake, you'll let me know immediately and all will be right with the world.)_
