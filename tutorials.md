# Tutorials

**NOTE: This information is for our "regular" tutorials, not the 4 tutorials where we run a coding quiz.**

## GitHub Classroom Assignment Links

These are the links to the GitHub Classroom "assignments" you need to accept and clone to a local repo to do the tutorials. Usually, these will only be made available early (like 4 AM?) on the morning of that tutorial.


_If there's no active hyperlink for the tutorial, it means that GH Classroom assignment isn't available (yet)._

## Preview Instructions

In order to help you prepare for tutorials, you can access the following "stripped-down" versions of some tutorials; they give you a general idea what the tutorial is about, without providing full details.

_If there's no active hyperlink for the tutorial, it means that preview's not available (yet)._
