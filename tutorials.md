# Tutorials

**NOTE: This information is for our "regular" tutorials, not the 4 tutorials where we run a coding quiz.**

## GitHub Classroom Assignment Links

These are the links to the GitHub Classroom "assignments" you need to accept and clone to a local repo to do the tutorials. Usually, these will only be made available early (like 4 AM?) on the morning of that tutorial.


_If there's no active hyperlink for the tutorial, it means that GH Classroom assignment isn't available (yet)._

## Instructions

### preview vs full instructions

In order to help you prepare for tutorials, I prepare "preview instructions" for most tutorials. These instructions are "stripped-down" versions of the full instructions: they give you a general idea what the tutorial is about, without providing full details. Some of them also suggest some things you can do ahead of time to make your life easier.

The full instructions for tutorials, like the GitHub Classroom links, will only be made available early in the morning (like 4 AM?) of a given tutorial.

_If there's no active hyperlink for the tutorial, it means that preview's not available (yet)._

### full instructions

Here are the full instructions for our tutorials. Like the GitHub Classroom links, these will only be made available early in the morning (like 4 AM?) of that tutorial.

_If there's no active hyperlink for the tutorial, it means those full instructions aren't available (yet)._
