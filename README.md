- You must be logged into your myMRU Gmail account to access the Meet.
- Tutorials will be held via Discord and will **not** be recorded.
- Please attend **your** tutorial section - I need to keep the numbers down in each time slot so I can distribute my time more effectively among those present.

## After the First Two Weeks (Jan 24 Onward)

With some luck, we'll be back live in the classroom from Jan 24 onward as per this schedule:

| Type | Section | Day | Time          | Location | CRN   |

# Instructor

![JP pic](images/jpratt_120x120.png)  
**name**: Jordan Pratt

**office**: The hole in the ground that is my basement. Also, my office in B103A at MRU, which is not wholly a hole.

**email**: jpratt@mtroyal.ca

**phone**: 403.440.6745 (W)

**office hours**: [my calendar](https://bit.ly/jp-wint-2022-schedule)

### Getting Help

I work full-time in the department as an instructional assistant (IA), supporting a bunch of courses, so I have expansive office hours! Take advantage of this, ok?

If you'd like to ask me a question, how you get help will depend on **where** you are and whether my schedule shows me being available.

If you are comfortable talking in person (it's my preferred mode of communication), please swing by my office. I even have a chair for guests. It's one of those crappy lab chairs, but it's still a chair **just for you**.

If you need to talk to me online (because you're home or kinda shy), then you _might_ be able to reach me online. You'll need to use the IA Help System to do so:

1. Look up the IA (that's Steve Kalmar and me) availability for the day: [bit.ly/comp-help-availability](http://bit.ly/comp-help-availability-w21)
2. When both **you and the IA you want to talk to** are available, fill out this form: [bit.ly/comp-help-form](https://bit.ly/comp-help-form)
3. Go to [bit.ly/comp-help-queue](https://bit.ly/comp-help-queue) to wait in line
4. When your entry gets a Meet link, go to that link - it's talkin' time!

> _Please don't send pics of your code in an email to ask a question - it drives me bonkers. Sending either a copy/paste of your code in an email, or, preferably, giving me a GitHub link, is better._

Other questions not involving code can be tossed my way via email. If emails arrive after office hours, I may or may not respond...depends on how life is going at that moment!

> **_Please don't DM me on Discord outside of tutorial hours - the Help System is meant to be a fair way for all students from different courses to ask questions. If one set of students gets to use Discord, it gives them a way to "jump the queue"...and that's not fair, dagnabbit. Also, I use Discord for personal reasons (I do have a life! kinda...) and when I'm using Discord after-hours, it's disruptive to have questions come in. Yeah, I guess I could have 2 different accounts, but my life is complicated enough._**

# Course Materials

There is a required textbook as well as recommended lab materials for this course. 

## Required Text

Connolly and Hoar, _Fundamentals of Web Development, Third Edition_ (Pearson, 2022)

You'll be asked to read sections from the textbook in order to prepare for lectures, so it's really in your best interest to purchase the textbook. 

The textbook is only offered in a 12-month access eText, which will likely annoy some people, but that is where the publishing company has taken us.

To get the text:

1. Visit https://www.pearson.com/en-ca.html
2. In the search box, enter Fundamentals of Web Development and select the book ($49.99 version).
3. Click the Buy Now button, which adds the ebook to the cart.
4. Enter postal code, which will add GST.
5. You can figure out the rest from there.


## Recommended Labs

You're able to purchase the labs at: https://funwebdev3rd.gumroad.com/l/lab-set-one

For about $15, you get the lab materials for chapters 3 through 14 of the textbook - these contain the starting and ending files for every lab exercise, so you can check your work. (Remember to give each exercise an honest effort before heading to the answer; otherwise, you're not really learning anything!)

> _Comment from JP: If you're planning on taking Web 3, or looking to polish your Web 1 skills, this is a particularly good bargain._

While the purchase of the labs is not mandatory, if you don't pick them up, you'll want to find other ways to practice the skills required to succeed in the course.

# Course Description

[Here's the Academic Calendar description](https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/preview_course.php?catoid=26&coid=39332&print).

Here's what Randy Connolly (who usually teaches the course and who wrote the textbook and who dresses much better than me) says about the course:

> This course focuses on the concepts and technologies needed to develop web-centric applications. The main topics are:
>
> • The overall architecture of contemporary Internet applications  
>  • JavaScript  
>  • PHP  
>  • Security
>
> Most students find the lab and assignment work in this course to be
> quite time-consuming [_JP aside: yeah...no kidding!_]. The second assignment typically requires the investment of 50-90 hours of work. Be sure to plan your life accordingly.
>
> This is a third-year university course in a sub-discipline in which
> SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING IS AN ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC.
> While there are labs and lectures to help you learn the content, a
> substantial amount of learning is going to come from your own
> explorations, from reading the textbook, and with labs and
> assignments.

# Assessment

| Assessment Name                   |      Weight |
| :-------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Assignment 1 (over 6 milestones)  |         19% |
| Assignment 2  (over 5 milestones) |         19% |
| Written Quizzes (4 @ 6%) *        |         24% |
| Coding Quizzes  (4 @ 6%) **       |         18% |
| Final Exam                        |         20% |
|                                   |             |
| karma Bonus ***                   | 0, 1, or 2% |

You can find all the dates and deadlines for these assessments [here](#course-assessment-dates--deadlines).

_* You will have 2 opportunities to rewrite written quizzes and improve your grade._  
_** I will take your best 3 of the 4 coding quiz marks to calculate your coding quiz grade._  
_*** If your karma at the end of the semester is Good, you will get 1% added to your final mark. Excellent will get you 2%._

## Assignments

Problem-solving techniques and skills can only be acquired through practice and through the study of increasingly more difficult problems. The assignments all involve problem-solving. It is very important that you understand how you solved the problem, and not just be happy with handing in an assignment that produces the requested results.

Assignments will require weeks of steady work. To keep everyone on pace, assignments will consist of a number of milestones, one per week throughout the entire semester.

### Milestone Marking

Each milestone will have a clear set of requirements that must be completed to reach a certain grade level. 

| Grade Level | Corresponding % |
| :---------- | :-------------: |
| Level 6     |       98%       |
| Level 5     |       88%       |
| Level 4     |       75%       |
| Level 3     |       65%       |
| Level 2     |       55%       |
| Level 1     |       25%       |
| Level 0     |       0%        |


### Milestone Late Policy

Milestones are expected to be handed in on time, but sometimes life happens. **After submitting your current work by the milestone deadline**, you (or your group) have the option of requesting a 48-hour extension to complete unmet requirements. There are a couple of details here you should know:

1. Every time you request an extension, your karma will go down. The more extensions you request, the more your karma decreases.
2. The improvement to your mark provided by the extension is limited by your (or your group's) karma level:
   1. Poor karma? Your mark can improve at most **1** level.
   2. Good karma? Your mark can improve at most **2** levels.
   3. Excellent karma? Your mark can improve at most **3** levels.

> _**Example:** Let's say that you're in a group with Good karma and have needed an extension. If your work at the time of the original deadline was at Level 3, then your resubmitted work will be at most Level 5, even if you complete all your unmet requirements. Likewise, if you're in a group with Poor karma and have submitted a Level 1 body of work by the original assignment deadline, using an extension will get you to at most Level 2._

## Written Quizzes (x4)

Written quizzes are closed-book assessments that will be held during lecture times and take 40 minutes. (The remaining 40 minutes will be spent going over the quiz.)

The quizzes will focus on understanding and applying the concepts taught in class. They will primarily be made up of multiple-choice, true-false, and short answer style questions.

Students will not normally be permitted to write a missed written quiz at a later date. If a quiz **is** missed, students will still have an opportunity to write the rewrite for that quiz. (Rewrites are covered next.)

### Written Quiz Rewrites (x2)

We all have written bad tests, for a variety of reasons. Recognizing this, there are two lecture days (Feb 17 and Mar 31) where students will have the opportunity to write a quiz that covers the topics of the previous 2 written quizzes.

The mark on the rewrite may be used by the student to replace one of the previous two written quiz marks if it is to their benefit.

> _**Example**: Suppose you got a 63% on written quiz 1 and 74% on written quiz 2. If you wrote the quiz 1 & 2 rewrite and got an 82%, your 63% quiz 1 mark would be replaced with the 82%. If instead you got 60% on the rewrite, your original quiz 1 and 2 marks would remain unchanged._

## Coding Quizzes (x4)

Coding quizzes are open-book assessments that will be held during tutorial times and take 40 minutes.

The quizzes will focus on the creation of working code that solves some small number of problems. The format will be the same as a standard tutorial.

The lowest coding quiz mark will be dropped when calculating your final grade for the coding quiz portion of the course.

Students will not usually be permitted to write a missed coding quiz at a later date. Instead, that quiz mark of 0 will be dropped. Missing 2 or more coding quizzes is not advised.

## Final Exam

The final exam will be a **3-hour exam** and will consist of a written portion followed by a coding portion. In effect, you can consider it a long written quiz followed by a long-ish coding quiz.

# karma

The **principle of karma**, according to Wikipedia, captures the idea that the

> _...intent and actions of an individual...influence the future of that individual_

Basically, karma is all about cause and effect.

In this course, you will be assigned a "karma rating" based on whether you decide to behave in ways that demonstrate your commitment to succeeding in this course. 

## Examples of Things That Improve karma

- buying the textbook
- buying the labs
- completing tasks in a timely fashion
- punctually attending lectures and tutorials
- communicating with your instructor
- asking for help when you're struggling with something
- showing improvement over time in assessments
- checking in on Blackboard regularly
- showing you are prepared for tutorials

***Consistent*** behaviour (for example, usually being on time for lectures) will improve karma faster than inconsistent behaviour.

Not surprisingly, doing the opposite of the above will worsen your karma.

## karma Levels

There are 4 levels of karma in this course:

- **Neutral** *(This is where everyone starts out when the course begins.)*
- **Good**
- **Excellent**
- **Poor**

You can always see your current karma level on Blackboard.

## Effects of Your Karma Level

Doing things that improve karma will, besides having numerous indirect positive effects on your learning, will have the following two direct effects as well:

1. Grade improvements for milestones. (see [Milestone Late Policy](#milestone-late-policy))
2. Bonus marks at the end of the course. (see [Assessment](#assessment))

Notice that you are never directly penalized for Poor karma: I'll never deduct marks for it. In my opinion, behaving in ways that worsen karma is destructive enough without adding to the pain.

## One Last Thing

This whole karma thing is not meant to be evaluation of you as a person - it's an evaluation of the actions you perform. You are not your actions. But your actions have consequences.

---

# Tutorials

Tutorials in this course will be used as a time for you to demonstrate that you can perform basic coding tasks under mild time pressure. Successfully doing so benefits you by:

- providing motivation to keep up with the course material,
- allowing you opportunities to see what course concepts you're comfortable with and which ones need work,
- giving you chances to practice in an environment identical to that of the coding quizzes and coding portion of the final exam, and
- being a way to improve your karma

Due to the temporary suspension of live classes, the first two labs will be held via Discord; after restrictions are lifted, we'll be working in B107.

Although you are encouraged to work on exercises by yourself, feel free to work with your peers if you're struggling with something. (And, of course, JP will be available in the tutorials for this purpose as well!)

> _Be careful when working with others on exercises; I've seen many students fool themselves into thinking they know how to do something when in fact they don't - watching someone do something and doing that thing yourself are wildly different things!_

The exercises you will be asked to complete are closely related to the lab exercises. By working on the lab exercises in a timely fashion, you will be well-prepared for the tutorial exercises.

In order to help you be prepared for the tutorials, the skills that you need to demonstrate will be provided to you well in advance. You will also be told what lab exercises you should complete to help with your preparation.

About 5 minutes before the start of tutorials, you'll be given access to a link to the full instructions for that tutorial.

JP will be circulating through the lab during the tutorial, providing feedback and gauging how prepared you were for the tutorial.

## Tutorials and karma

Just showing up for tutorials in a punctual fashion will improve your karma, particularly if you do so consistently. 

Your karma will improve even further if JP can tell you have come prepared for the tutorial.

---

# Course Policies

## Attendance

There is **no attendance requirement** in this course - I **won't** deduct marks if you don't show up for lectures or tutorials. 

That being said, education research shows - conclusively - that **just showing up and paying attention** is one of the best things you can do to be successful in any course.

As such, attendance (ideally punctual and consistent) is definitely something that improves your [karma](#karma).


## Late Submissions

See the [milestone late policy](#milestone-late-policy).

#### Technical Issues

A **student’s** technical difficulties will **not** usually be an acceptable excuse for late submissions. Start early, back up your work, and don't tempt fate.

**MRU'S** technical difficulties **may** warrant modifications to due dates/times. This is at the instructor's discretion and modifications will be communicated as soon as reasonably possible once the issue has been examined.

#### Illness and Unforeseen Circumstances

Serious illness or other unforeseen circumstances that might have an effect on submissions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Communicate with me early and clearly if something serious is happening in your life and we'll work something out.

Last-minute communications will likely be met with some resistance.

---

# Required Technology

### Third-party Tools and Accounts

Rather than submitting the assignments to a university submit drive, you will be submitting code for marking on third-party sites such as GitHub, Netlify, Google Cloud Platform, and Heroku. 

You will need to create accounts with these third-party sites and tools and accept the terms of service for developer access to these services. Students are advised that, if the site allows it, to limit personal information entered into the software as the data resides with the software company outside of the University.

In the event you do not wish to use a particular third-party party tool you can opt out. Do note that this will require you to research and suggest an alternative service, which may be acceptable depending on the characteristics of the tool. You agree that the instructor will have sole authority to decide if an alternative is acceptable.

If any of this gives you pause, you should consider withdrawing from the course now, while you can still have your fees refunded.

### Hardware

You'll need a computer over which you have administrative control, since you'll be installing some software on it.

The tools we'll be using are cross-platform, so it won't matter whether you're using a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine. The system requirements for these tools are pretty low, so most machines purchased within the last 4 years or so should be perfectly fine. If you have any concerns, it's best to reach out to me and we'll talk.

### Software

#### Browser

Online lectures and tutorials will be run synchronously in **Google Meet**, so you'll need an **internet-enabled computer** with a **current web browser**. (Google Chrome is recommended.) If you are unfamiliar with Meet, take a look at [these tutorials](https://sites.google.com/mtroyal.ca/techtuts/google-apps/google-meet) available from MRU.

> _Headsets/microphones and webcams are not mandatory, but during [midterm re-do attempts](#perks-for-midterm-question-do-overs), I **very much** want to have a face-to-face talk. If you feel you can't make this happen, I need to know about it and I need a very good reason from you._
>
> _During lectures, it is best to mute your mics and disable the camera. When you ask a question or make a comment, then you may turn on your microphone (and your camera if you wish). Once done, please mute your microphones and disable your camera._

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, cross-platform text editor that has become very commonly used in our industry. I strongly recommend that you install it and use it for your coursework.

If you wish to do your work with some other editor, I won't stop you. (I won't provide any tech support either.) Keep in mind that if your choice of editor causes complications with tutorials or assignments, that's on you.

#### Git Client

You'll be submitting tutorial exercises, assignments, and exams to GitHub, which means you need to be able to run Git commands on your computer. You can follow [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get your computer Git-ready, if it's not already. If you have an older version of GitHub on your machine, I would recommend updating it.

#### XAMPP

When we start PHPing in late October / early November, you'll need to grab [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). It's free and cross-platform.

# Academic Accommodations

## Disability-Related Accommodations

Students registered with Access and Inclusion Services and having an Academic Accommodation Letter should schedule a private conversation with me, as soon as possible, to discuss how your accommodations will be implemented into the design of this course. A conversation may take place in-person, online, or over the phone. Requests to discuss accommodations during or between classes will not be accepted. Acknowledgement of your accommodations will then be provided via email or Faculty Acknowledgement Form, depending on course delivery method.

If you are a student who experiences disability-related barriers and has not registered with Access and Inclusion Services, you may wish to inquire about services by [contacting the Access and Inclusion Services office directly](https://www.mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/ResourcesServices/AccessibilityServices/ContactUs/index.htm).

## Non-Disability-Related Accommodations

Students requiring non-disability-related academic accommodations (as related to the protected grounds in Human Rights Legislation) are encouraged to contact Access and Inclusion Services to explore what academic accommodations may be available to assist them in order to participate fully in their academic studies.

You may wish to inquire about services by [contacting the Access and Inclusion Services office directly](https://www.mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/ResourcesServices/AccessibilityServices/ContactUs/index.htm).

# Academic Integrity

## Student Code of Conduct

Students and faculty at MRU share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship. This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education. Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by MRU’s regulations in the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.mtroyal.ca/CampusServices/CampusResources/StudentCommunityStandards/_pdfs/code_of_student_conduct_policy.pdf) which sets out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, non-academic misconduct and student rights and responsibilities.

Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action. Academic misconduct includes: plagiarism, copying or allowing one’s own work to be copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and quizzes, submitting work prepared in collaboration with another student when such collaboration has not been authorized, among other academic offences. A lack of familiarity with MRU’s regulations on academic conduct does not constitute a defense against its application. Additional resources and tools for students can be found at the Office of [Student Community Standards](https://www.mtroyal.ca/CampusServices/CampusResources/StudentCommunityStandards/).

## Cheatin'

I think at this point in your academic career, you know what cheating is. I don't really want to beat this dead horse, but here I am, stick in hand. I'll let others do the talking.

Here's Randy's take on things:

> Normally, the sanction for any student accused of cheating will be zero on the assignment (in the case of one student giving part of his/her assignment to another student, both students are considered to be cheating). Sanctions for further incidents of cheating by the same student will be reviewed by the Academic Integrity Board and may ultimately result in expulsion from the University.
>
> While students are expected to work reasonably independently, we do not expect you to work in isolation. Often you learn best when working with others on an assignment. So what degree of collaboration is expected and, indeed, encouraged, and what is deemed to be cheating?
>
> In general, we encourage things like bouncing ideas off one another, discussing which of two alternate solutions might be better (and why), and getting another's ideas on how to resolve a difficulty that you have already spent time on. You should not be working so closely together that someone else's solution becomes incorporated into your product. These general guidelines apply to any type of assignment. Some more detailed guidelines for programming assignments follow.
>
> When you get to the point of writing the actual program, you must work independently. It is NOT acceptable to be coding with others. Write your program by taking your design, possibly fleshing out some details, and writing the code in the appropriate programming language. If you have difficulty with a certain statement, check your notes or your text. If you are still having problems with the code, then you can ask others for help. However, you must master the language as quickly as possible, and not rely on others. When quizing the program, if you are having problems with a section and have spent some time trying to find the problem yourself, it is a good idea to ask others if they can help you. Other people will often see errors that you cannot see because you are too close to your solution – that is, you
> no longer see it clearly. Don't forget that if you need help at any time, the Instructional Assistant and your Instructor are available.
>
> When complete, two students' programs should be essentially independent of one another. Each student should have attempted each step of the problem solving method alone before discussing it with others. In this way you can develop your own skills, while still learning from (and helping) others.

I really like what Harvard's CS50X course has to say about [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty). It's a lot shorter and makes sense to my brain.

# Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act

As you may know, MRU is governed by the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (“FOIP”). In addition to providing a mechanism for requesting records held by the university, this legislation also requires that MRU not disclose the personal information of its students without their consent.

The personal information that you provide to Mount Royal University is collected under the authority of the Post-Secondary Learning Act and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act - section 33(c).

Collected personal information is protected from unauthorized access, collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with the FOIP Act and can be reviewed upon request subject to the provisions under the Act.

# Course Evaluations

All universities in Alberta are required by the CAQC (Campus Alberta Quality Council) to provide their students with the opportunity to evaluate their instructors.

Student evaluation of teaching is a highly valued and helpful mechanism for monitoring the quality of MRU’s programs and instructional effectiveness. Students are encouraged to participate actively in this process and will be notified of the dates.

# Student Resources
