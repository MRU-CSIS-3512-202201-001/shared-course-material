# Educational Outcomes - COMP3512

> _This is verbatim from previous versions of the course outline...my own nod to copy-pasta. You can tell this has been around for a while - the references to "college" are a giveaway!_ :)

Mount Royal College had identified six college-wide learning outcomes that it believes are critical in order to prepare its graduates for workplace success and a life of continuous learning. Generally speaking, “outcomes” are goals, results, objectives that you should derive from the College, from a program of study, and from a particular course. This course will emphasize the following outcomes:
